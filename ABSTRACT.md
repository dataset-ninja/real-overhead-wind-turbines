The authors of the dataset present a collection of overhead images of wind turbines along with corresponding YOLOv3 formatted labels for object detection. The labels provide essential information, such as the class, x and y coordinates, and the height and width of the bounding boxes for each wind turbine in the respective image.

The motivation behind this work is to explore the application of deep learning in the analysis of energy infrastructure. The authors aim to extend this approach to encompass various types of energy infrastructure, creating a comprehensive pipeline for in-depth energy infrastructure analysis. Such an analysis could offer valuable insights for energy access decision makers, enabling them to make informed choices on how to provide electricity to non-electrified regions, considering options like grid extension, micro-grids, or localized power generation.

For data acquisition, the images were sourced from the [Power Plant Satellite Imagery Dataset](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Power_Plant_Satellite_Imagery_Dataset/5307364). Subsequently, these images were carefully hand-labeled and transformed into properly formatted labels. The authors then performed data preprocessing, resizing the images to smaller dimensions of 608x608 and adjusting their corresponding labels accordingly, following the YOLOv3 format.
