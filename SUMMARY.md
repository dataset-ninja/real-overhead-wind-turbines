**Overhead Imagery of Wind Turbines** is a dataset for an object detection task. Possible applications of the dataset could be in the energy industry. The dataset presented here is not the original one. Learn more on the dataset's [homepage](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Overhead_Imagery_of_Wind_Turbines/12744977).

The dataset consists of 2065 images with 6396 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*wind turbines*).

Images in the Overhead Imagery of Wind Turbines (by Duke Dataplus2020) dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 512 (25% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *train* (1652 images) and *val* (413 images). The original dataset was released in 2020.

Here is the visualized example grid with annotations:
