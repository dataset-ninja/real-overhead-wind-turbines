**Overhead Imagery of Wind Turbines** is a dataset for object detection tasks. It is used in the energy industry.

The dataset consists of 2065 images with 6396 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*wind turbines*).

Each image in the Wind Turbines 3 dataset has bounding box annotations. There are 512 (25% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *val* (413 images) and *train* (1652 images). The dataset was released in 2020.

Here is the visualized example grid with annotations:
